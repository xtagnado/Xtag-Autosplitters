# Xtag-Autosplitters
I did some autosplitters to my speedruns, i've changed the ALTTP asl file by my own, so... it can work wrongly sometimes.

<h1>How to setup autosplitters in my Livesplit?</h1>

Download the .asl file.

Open your Livesplit software.

Right click in Livesplit (i use 1.8.21 livesplit) then click in "Edit Layout...". In layout editor click on "+" button, choose "control" in hover menu then "Scriptable Auto Splitter".
When you click it a new item will be showed in layout setup, double click on "Scriptable Auto Splitter". Now in "Script Path" you can choose your autosplitter location. Leave the "Start", "Split" and "Reset" checkboxs marked.<br>
I'm not developer so the autosplitter could works wrongly in some cases.

Version note:<br>
The autosplitters is made by modifing the ALTTP's autosplitter and works in the following emulators:
- Snes9x-rr 1.52 | 1.54 | 1.60 (x86 and x64)
- Snes9x 1.53 | 1.54 | 1.54.1 | 1.55 | 1.56 | 1.57 | 1.58 | 1.59.2 | 1.60 (x86 and x64)
- Higan v102 | v103 | v104 | v105tr1 | v106 | v106.112 | v107 | v108 | v109 | v110 (x86 and x64).
- Bsnes v107 | v107.1 | v107.2 | v107.3 | v108 | v109 | v110 | v111 | v112 | v115
- BizHawk (BSnes Core) 2.3.0 | 2.3.0 | 2.3.2 | 2.6.0 | 2.7.0 | 2.8 (BSnes, BSnes v115+, Snes9x and Faust Cores)
- Ares v115 | v117 | v118 | v121a | v122 | v123 | v124 | v125 | v126 | v127 | v128 | v129.

The Retroarch and RALibRetro won't worked consistently, so maybe in the future i'll upgrade the autosplitters.
